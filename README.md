Duplicate Detection: Identify and filter duplicate stories across sources

Example AI integration code snippet:

python
# Example AI summarization function
def summarize_headlines(headlines):
    import openai
    # Initialize OpenAI client
    # Process each headline and generate summary
    # Return enhanced data
💰 Monetization

🎨 Customization
Adding New News Sources
Create a new scraper in the scrapers/ directory:

python
from scrapers.base_scraper import BaseScraper

class NewSourceScraper(BaseScraper):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("NewSource", "https://newsource.com")
    
    def scrape(self):
        # Implementation specific to the new source
        soup = self.fetch_static_content(self.base_url)
        # Parse and extract headlines
        # Use self.add_headline() to add each headline
Add the source to config/news_sites.json

Import and add the scraper to the list in main.py

Custom Export Formats
Extend the file handlers to support additional formats:

python
# In utils/file_handlers.py
def export_to_custom_format(data, filename):
    # Implement custom export logic
    pass
📸 Screenshots
The application automatically generates a screenshot of the aggregated headlines table, saved as news_feed_<date>.png in the exports directory.

Example output:

text
Source     Headline                                      Link
BBC        Important breaking news story                https://www.bbc.com/news/123
CNN        Major development in world events            https://edition.cnn.com/456
